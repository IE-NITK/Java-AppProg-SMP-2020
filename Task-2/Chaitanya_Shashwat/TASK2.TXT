Q1. Write the commands you’ll use to create the above three tables, with appropriate
datatypes (Use the ‘time’ datatype for Departure and Arrival). Also write the commands
for inserting the data into these tables.
ANSWER:
create table Stations (SID varchar(20) PRIMARY KEY, SName varchar(20) UNIQUE);
->INSERT INTO STATIONS VALUES('MAJN','MANGALURU JUNCTION'); 
->INSERT INTO STATIONS VALUES('MAQ','MANGALURU CENTRAL');
->INSERT INTO STATIONS VALUES('SL','SURATHKAL');
create table Trains (TID int PRIMARY KEY, TName varchar(20) NOT NULL, Source varchar(20), Destination varchar(20),foreign key(Source) references stations(SID),foreign key(Destination) references stations(SID));
->INSERT INTO trains VALUES(22000,'MANGALURU EXPRESS','SL','MAQ'); 
->INSERT INTO trains VALUES(22001,'MANGALURU EXPRESS','MAQ','SL');
->INSERT INTO trains VALUES(22100,'CITY LOCAL','MAJN','MAQ'); 
->INSERT INTO trains VALUES(22101,'CITY LOCAL','MAQ','MAJN');
->INSERT INTO trains VALUES(22200,'CITY EXPRESS','MAJN','MAQ');
->INSERT INTO trains VALUES(22201,'CITY EXPRESS','MAQ','MAJN'); 
create table Schedule (TID int, Departure time, Arrival time, foreign key(TID) references trains(TID));
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22000,'09:00:00','09:30:00');
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22000,'12:00:00','12:30:00'); 
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22001,'10:30:00','11:00:00');
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22001,'13:30:00','14:00:00');
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22100,'15:00:00','15:15:00');
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22101,'16:45:00','17:00:00');
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22200,'18:00:00','18:10:00');
->INSERT INTO SCHEDULE VALUES(22201,'19:50:00','20:00:00'); 


Q2. Write a query to display the details (i.e. the TID, TName, Source and Destination) of
the train with TID 22001.
ANSWER:
SELECT * FROM TRAINS WHERE TID=22001;


Q3. Write a query to display the SName of the stations whose SID begins with ‘MA’.
ANSWER:
SELECT SNAME FROM STATIONS WHERE SID LIKE 'MA%';


Q4. Write a query to display the schedule (i.e. TID, Departure and Arrival) of the trains
which have departure after 15:30:00 and before 17:00:00.
ANSWER:
SELECT * FROM SCHEDULE WHERE DEPARTURE BETWEEN '15:30:00' AND '17:00:00'; 


Q5. Write a query to display the TName of the trains whose TName begins with ‘City’ and
destination is MAQ.
ANSWER:
SELECT TNAME FROM TRAINS WHERE TNAME LIKE 'CITY%' AND DESTINATION LIKE 'MAQ';


Q6. Write a command to change the ‘SName’ of the station having ‘SID’ as SL to
‘Surathkal Station’.
ANSWER:
UPDATE STATIONS SET SNAME='SURATHKAL STATION' WHERE SID='SL'; 


Q7. Write a command to add a column ‘District’ to the Stations table, with datatype
varchar(30).
ANSWER:
ALTER TABLE STATIONS ADD DISTRICT VARCHAR(30); 


Q8. Write a command to add a DEFAULT constraint to the newly added ‘District’ column.
Set this default to ‘District404’.
ANSWER:
ALTER TABLE STATIONS ALTER DISTRICT SET DEFAULT 'District404';


Q9. Write a single command to update the value of District for all stations to ‘Dakshina
Kannada’
ANSWER:
UPDATE STATIONS SET DISTRICT='Dakshina Kannada';


Q10. Write a single command to change both the name of the District column to ‘Dist’ and
the datatype to char(30).
ANSWER:
ALTER TABLE STATIONS CHANGE DISTRICT DIST CHAR(30);


Q11. Write a command to delete the Dist column.
ANSWER:
ALTER TABLE STATIONS DROP COLUMN DIST;


Q12. Write a command to delete the UNIQUE constraint applied on SName in the
Stations table.
ANSWER:
ALTER TABLE STATIONS DROP CONSTRAINT SName;


Q13. Write a command to delete the schedule of the trains having TID as 22000 or
22001.
ANSWER:
DELETE FROM SCHEDULE WHERE TID LIKE '2200%';


Q14. Write a query to display the TID of the train having the latest departure time.
ANSWER:
SELECT TID FROM SCHEDULE WHERE DEPARTURE=(SELECT MAX(DEPARTURE) FROM SCHEDULE);


Q15. (Challenge problem) Write a query to display the TName, Source and Destination of
the train which has the latest departure time.
ANSWER:
SELECT TNAME, SOURCE, DESTINATION FROM TRAINS WHERE TID=(SELECT TID FROM SCHEDULE WHERE DEPARTURE=(SELECT MAX(DEPARTURE) FROM SCHEDULE));
